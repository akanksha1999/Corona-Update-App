# Corona-Update-App
A corona virus application that spreads awareness by visualizing live data that is fetched from an API.I built this application to get a better understanding of Async/Await ,React Hooks and also explored a bit of Material UI and Chart.js . This project also improved my understanding of Folder structure in React.
